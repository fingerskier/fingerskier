	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	
	<p>This site is dedicated to things that interest me.&nbsp;<span> I am a drilling professional in the energy industry (oil/gas/mining).&nbsp;</span><span> I am also a professional developer with an emphasis on web technologies.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p>The code-stash is a collection of useful snippets and info that I use day-to-day.&nbsp;<span> The calc is [mostly] formulae that I use in the execution of drilling operations.&nbsp;</span><span> Both of these are works in progress that I am continually updating.&nbsp;</span><em> Neither are authoritative nor carry any guarantee of accuracy or completeness.&nbsp;</em></p>

	<p>This site is composed using Javascript via the Meteor.js framework and Bootstrap for style.&nbsp;<span> If you have a need to contact me please feel free to throw me an email: fingerskier at gmail dot com.&nbsp;</span><span> Also, check out the&nbsp;<b><a href="http://fingerskier.blogspot.com">blog</a></b>.</span></p>
